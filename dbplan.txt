FIXED TABLES:
rawTokenCount: day, token, daytokcount (PK = day + token)
daytotal: day, totaltokens (PK = day)


(Could generate each time, but won't)
dailystats: day, token, rank, proportion (PK = day + token)

proportion = daytokcount/totaltokens


GENERATE EACH TIME:

token,min_rank,max_rank,rank_range,min_count,max_count,count_range,min_prop,max_prop,prop_range,#days


next step:
reduce rawtokencount to only tokens used more than... twice
and used on more than one day unless single day use > 10
^^this table will be the one i will work with primarily

CREATE TABLE dailystats as
SELECT raw.day as day,
        raw.token as token,
        daytokcount/totaltokens as proportion
FROM rawTokenCount as raw, daytotal as daytotal
WHERE rawtoken.token = daytotal.token;
